Get your right type of coffee â˜•

Go application that provides information on the best type of coffee based on user input characteristics. 
It uses two data sources: the ChatGPT API and a database populated by ETL from a dataset, this dataset was gathered from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/volpatto/coffee-quality-database-from-cqi) (kudos for the author), see there for further details.

## Usage

To run the application, you need to have:
- Go installed
- Chat GPT API key, you can create one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Postgres URL (_optimal_)
  - explain

The application has two command entry points:

### API
To start the HTTP API, run the following command:

```shell
make run
```

This will start the API server on port `3000`.
You can then find the full OpenAPI/Swagger spec definition [here](./api/openapi.yaml), or you can send a request to the following endpoint:

`GET /v1/best-coffees`: Returns the best type of coffee based on user given characteristics.

### CLI
To start the command line interface, run the following command:

```shell
go run cmd/cli/main.go --CHAT_GPT_KEY <your_chat_gpt_key> --DATABASE_URL <database_url>
```

This will run the CLI interface, which will output the best coffees for you.

## Data Sources

It uses two data sources:

### ChatGPT API
The ChatGPT API is used to generate responses to user feedback. The application sends user feedback to the API and receives a response based on the user's input.

### Database
The application also uses a database that is populated by ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) dataset data.
