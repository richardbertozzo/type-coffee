Get your right type of coffee â˜•

Go application that provides information on the best type of coffee based on user input characteristics. 
It uses two data sources: the **Google Gemini API** and a **database** populated by ETL from a dataset. 
This dataset was gathered from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/volpatto/coffee-quality-database-from-cqi) (kudos for the author), see there for further details.

## Usage

To run the application, you need to have:
- Go installed
- Google Gemini API key, you can create one [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- Postgres URL (_optional_)
  - You can run a local docker instance by running the command `$ make pg-up` or pointing to any other instance, like a cloud instance

The application has tree command entry points:

### ETL

This entrypoint has the responsibility to get the [Coffee CSV dataset](./data), convert the rows and 
then insert them into the Postgres database.

It will create and populate the second data source to retrieve the best type of coffee for you, 
which you can get using the other 2 commands, **API** and **CLI**. 

This is optimal if only want the Gemini API result, so skip it. 

You can run the ETL by the command:

```shell
go run cmd/etl/main.go --DATABASE_URL <database_url>
```

### API

To get started, set up your local environment by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and configuring the necessary variables.

You can choose to run either an **HTTP REST API** or a **gRPC server**:

- HTTP REST API: Runs by default unless gRPC is enabled.
- gRPC Server: To enable gRPC, set the `GRPC_ENABLED` variable to true in your `.env` file.

Once you've configured your environment, start the server using the following command:

```shell
make run
```

The application will launch the selected server (HTTP or gRPC) on the default port, or on a custom port defined in your `.env` file.

#### For API documentation:

- The full [OpenAPI/Swagger spec](./api/openapi.yaml) is available for the HTTP API.
- The gRPC service uses the [protobuf definition](./api/coffee.proto).

**Example Endpoint:**
`GET /v1/best-coffees`: Retrieves the best type of coffee based on user-provided characteristics.

### CLI
To start the command line interface, run the following command:

```shell
go run cmd/cli/main.go --CHAT_GPT_KEY <your_chat_gpt_key> --DATABASE_URL <database_url>
```

This will run the CLI interface, which will output the best coffees for you from the selected characteristics.

## Data Sources

It uses two data sources:

### Gemini API
The Gemini API is used to generate responses to user feedback. The application sends user feedback to the API and receives a response based on the user's input.

### Database
The application also uses a database that is populated by ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) dataset data.
